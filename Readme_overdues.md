# 📊 Financial Dashboards – Overdues & Headcount | All4Labels

This repository showcases two dynamic **Power BI dashboards** developed at **All4Labels** as part of a real-world data analytics project. These dashboards provide actionable insights into **overdue payments** and **headcount distribution**, enabling smarter financial planning and performance tracking.

## 🔍 Overview

As a Data Analyst at All4Labels, I worked closely with the finance and HR teams to develop two dashboards:

1. **Overdues Dashboard**
2. **Headcount Dashboard**

These dashboards were designed to support strategic decision-making through visual, filterable KPIs derived from large-scale data pipelines.
